/*Pointers reference a location in memory where a value is stored rather than the value
itself. By using a pointer (*int), the zero  function is able to modify the original vari‚Äê

In Go, a pointer is represented using an asterisk (*) followed by the type of the stored
value. In the zerofunction, xPtris a pointer to an int.
